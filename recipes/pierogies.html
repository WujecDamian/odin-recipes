    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My great-grandmother's recipe. A little bit of work, but well worth it. We
      make about 200 every Christmas Eve, and everyone can't wait. The amounts
      for the ingredients is an estimate, because my great-grandmother does not
      measure! Serve with a side of sour cream.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make Dough: Mix sour cream and flour into a dough. Roll it out 1/16
          inch thick and cut into 3.5-inch rounds.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill & Seal: Place 1 tsp of mashed potatoes on each round. Fold into a
          half-moon and seal the edges with a fork. Cover with a towel.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Sauté Onions: Cook onions in butter until translucent; set onions
          aside but keep the butter in the skillet.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Boil: Drop pierogies in boiling water. Once they float, boil for 4
          minutes.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Sear & Serve: Pan-fry the boiled pierogies in the onion butter for 3
          minutes until browned. Top with the cooked onions and keep warm in a
          low oven.
