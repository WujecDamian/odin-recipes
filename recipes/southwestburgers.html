    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These zesty burgers are bursting with flavor. Taco seasoning, peppers, and
      pepperjack cheese give ground beef a boost. Then the patties are served up
      on buns with sour cream and salsa. A fun twist on barbecued burgers!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat grill for high heat.
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, taco seasoning mix, bell
        pepper and onion using your hands. Form into 6 patties.
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly oil the grill grate. Cook burger patties for 5 minutes per side,
        or until well done. Place buns cut side down onto the grill to toast
        during the last minute or so. Top each burger with a slice of cheese
        before removing from the grill. Serve burgers on toasted buns topped
        with salsa and sour cream.
